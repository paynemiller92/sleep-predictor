Running Sleep Predictor
---

1. From a console: type `java -jar sleep-predictor.jar`	
2. When promted, specify the path to the questionnaire.csv file (included both in project and in the submission on Canvas)
  - It's easier when the file is located in the same directory as the where you ran the JAR file. In that case, you just need to type `questionnaire.csv` and hit ENTER.
